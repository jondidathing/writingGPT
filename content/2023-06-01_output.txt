 Becoming a Stoic is a journey of self-discovery and self-control. It involves understanding your emotions and learning to detach yourself from them. To become a Stoic, start by reflecting on what is truly important in life and what has no real lasting value. 

Next, focus on the present moment and practice gratitude for what you have, rather than wishing for what you don’t have. Show resilience in the face of adversity and use your energy to take positive action on what you can. Additionally, practice self-discipline and moderation in all areas of life, such as eating healthy, staying active and being mindful of how you’re spending your time.
